        <p>How Did The Football Gradually Developed Over The Years?</p>
      </div>

      <div class="para-1">
        <h2 class="subtitle">Early Era</h2>
        <p>Records trace the history of soccer back more than 2,000 years ago to ancient China. Greece, Rome, and parts of Central America also claim to have started the sport; but it was England that transitioned soccer, or what the British and many other people around the world call “football,” into the game we know today</p>
      </div>

      <div class="para-2">
        <h2 class="subtitle">Middle Era</h2>
          <p>As the sport developed, more rules were implemented and more historical landmarks were set. For example, the penalty kick was introduced in 1891. FIFA became a member of the International Football Association Board of Great Britain in 1913. Red and yellow cards were introduced during the 1970 World Cup finals. More recent major changes include goalkeepers being banned from handling deliberate back passes in 1992 and tackles from behind becoming red-card penalties in 1998.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="para-2">
        <h2 class="subtitle">Current Era</h2>
          <p>Today there are 211 national associations included in the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the world governing body of the sport. Another proof of the globalization could be seen in the increase of nations participating in the World Cup qualifiers: from 32 in 1934 to over 200 in 2014.</p>
